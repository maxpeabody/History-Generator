History Generator

Dev Order
=========
- FIRST: Random generation of individual cultures
- SECOND: Random generation of continents and how they border each other
- THIRD: Assigning cultures to empires; assigning empires and independent cultures to continents
- FOURTH: Events and interactions between cultures/empires

Simplified version
=================
(NECESSARY CLASSES: Continent, Biome, Empire, Culture)
- Generate array of continents
-- ID
-- Name
-- Size
-- Array 2-3 climates, each w/ a major geographical feature
-- Empty array of empires, empty array of cultures
-- Empty array of religions
- Determine how continents border each other (Foreach) (Array by ID of continent)
-- If the same continent, just call the border "same" or leave it null
-- If "num borders tracker" >= 2, assign all remaining borders as "distant land"
-- Check if a relationship exists w/ other continent
--- "Does it border two continents already?"
---- If so, assign: "near overseas" or "distant land"
--- "Does it border any other continent?"
---- If so AND this continent also borders that one, assign: "near overseas" or
	the same border
---- Else, assign: any value NOT on the same axis (i.e., if 1 borders 2 on the north,
	it cannot border 3 on the south - only the east or west)
--- If it borders no other continent, assign: anything BUT "distant land"
---- This way there should be a maximum of, like, one "Australia"
--- Randomly add either 1 or 2 to "num borders tracker" if anything besides "distant land" was chosen

- Determine # of empires + # of cultures
-- Empires: 50%-100% the amount of continents, rounded up
-- Cultures: Avg. [var] per continent
- Distribute cultures
-- Determine each continent's size as % of entire planet
--- Some randomization? (Low priority)
-- Assign cultures accordingly, then check for extras + distribute them randomly

- (Foreach culture) in foreach continent
-- Name (pick 2-4 syllables, then possibly add "ish"/"lish", "ese", or "ian" to the end)
--- Make sure to factor in pluralization!
-- On border? On coast?
-- Terrain? (Only spawn "coastal" if country on coast)
-- Major industry (randomized; can be based on terrain)
-- Food stuff?
-- Starting religion
-- Government type
-- Empty array of famous people (founders of empires; prophets + 
	convert kings; great artists, scientists, theologians, philosophers)
-- Empty "history" array to hold all events that occur in chronological
	order

- Events
-- CIVIL WAR (Two parameters: Thing to change + new value)
--- Dissidents are crushed
--- Dissidents take power
---- Modify culture accordingly
--- Country splits apart permanently
---- IF CULTURE: Create new culture on same or (if on border) bordering
	continent, patterned off existing one but modified accordingly
---- Remove all countries from empire + delete empire
-- WAR WITH [COUNTRY]
--- White peace
--- X conquers Y
---- IF CULTURE IN EMPIRE: Y may or may not join empire
---- IF CULTURE NOT IN EMPIRE: X may or may not form a new empire
--- X forces Y to convert
--- X is driven back by Y
--- X loots Y
--- Y humiliates X
--- X is destabilized and falls into civil war
--- SECONDARY, IF X OR Y HAS RIVAL: [X/Y] forms an alliance with Z
	(the two will almost always stop being rivals)
--- SECONDARY: X and Y become rivals
-- RELIGIOUS
--- Religions will never completely disappear; it can be assumed that
	smaller cultures + pockets of apostasy will always exist
--- Missionaries from X visit Y and establish a community
--- IF MONARCHY OR THEOCRACY: Ruler of X converts and the nation follows
---- On very rare occasions, may also create entire new heresy
--- Religious schism
---- Never will EVERY country following a certain religion convert
---- May lead to civil war
-- SCIENCE
-- CULTURE
--- X makes tremendous strides in [art/literature/music/science/
	philosophy/theology]
--- A(n) X historian writes a comprehensive text on the region
--- X's dominant industry changes
--- X [cuisine/writing/art/music] influences the Ys
--- Xs and Ys become friends (or fall out)
--- Xs and Ys become rivals (or mend fences)
--- IF FRIENDS: X and Y form a federation/personal union/coalition
	government
--- IF FRIENDS: X and Y cultural exchange OR X cultural dominance
over Y (in the former, 1/3 chance of swapping either way; in the latter,
1/2 chance of X supplanting Y in any given respect)
--- IF RIVALS AND IN EMPIRE: Empire experiences civil war

=================
- Generate map
- Define continents
-- Divide them at chokepoints & water barriers; that is, loop thru area of the map until only one "new" square adjacent,
then call that a continent
- Determine number of cultures
-- Continents * (cultures per empire + 3)
- Randomly generate base details of new cultures
- Distribute cultures
--
